# Summary

The massive deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, 
requires energy storage over longer periods, to cover the energy demand at all times.
Among others, renewable energy storage in the form of hydrogen is gaining a lot of attention. 
The stored energy can be recovered in multiple sectors:
hydrogen can be converted back into electricity (power-to-power),
it can be used to produce low-carbon fuels (power-to-fuel),
and it can be used to fuel hydrogen vehicles (power-to-mobility).
The performance of these hydrogen-based energy systems is subject to uncertainties, 
e.g., the solar irradiance, the energy consumption of hydrogen-powered buses and the price of grid electricity.
Disregarding these uncertainties in the design process for these systems can result in a drastic mismatch between simulated and real-world performance, 
and thus lead to a kill-by-randomness of the system.
RHEIA provides a robust design optimization algorithm, which considers real-world uncertainties and yields design solutions that are least-sensitive to these uncertainties in their performance, i.e., the robust design.
Moreover, models are included to evaluate the techno-economic and environmental performance of hydrogen in a power-to-fuel, power-to-power and power-to-mobility context.
When combined, RHEIA unlocks the robust designs for hydrogen-based energy systems.


# Statement of need

In design optimization of renewable energy systems, the optimization is often performed with deterministic parameters (i.e. fixed, free from inherent variation)
and incorporating hydrogen in the renewable energy system is still an anomaly [@Eriksson2017]. 
Considering fixed values for model parameters in design optimization yields designs sensitive to real-world uncertainties
and results in a drastic mismatch between simulated and actual performances.
Alternatively, robust design optimization considers uncertainties on the model parameters during design optimization.
The method yielded improved design quality in structural mechanics, aerospace and automobile applications over the last two decades [@Chatterjee2017].
To ensure the computational tractability of robust design optimization, considering surrogate modelling techniques is suggested
to propagate the uncertainties through the system model. However, applications of such surrogate-assisted robust design optimization techniques are limited [@Chatterjee2017].
To fill these research gaps, RHEIA provides a multi-objective robust design optimization algorithm,
for which the propagation of the uncertainties is performed through Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE).
In addition, RHEIA includes Python-based models for the main valorization pathways of hydrogen: power-to-fuel, power-to-power and power-to-mobility.
The significant techno-economic and environmental uncertainties for these models are characterized based on scientific literature
and a method is included to gather climate data and demand data for the location of interest.
Finally, RHEIA allows connecting your own models to the robust design optimization and uncertainty quantification algorithm as well.   

Several software exist which include the evaluation of hydrogen-based energy systems,
e.g., [INSEL](https://insel.eu/en/home_en.html), [EnergyPLAN](https://www.energyplan.eu/) and [TRNSYS](http://www.trnsys.com/).
Despite their extensive component model libraries, these software lack an optimization feature.
[HOMER Energy](https://www.homerenergy.com/products/pro/index.html) includes an optimization algorithm to design hybrid microgrids, including hydrogen system component models.
In Python, Calliope [@pfenninger2018calliope] considers the optimization of multi-scale energy system models, where hydrogen is considered as a fuel in advanced gas turbines.
However, for both software, neither multi-objective problems, nor uncertainties during design optimization can be considered.

<!---
what about dakota? mention it, where are we different?
Separate modules for surrogate-assisted robust design optimization are present as well:
The DEAP package [@fortin2012deap] includes evolutionary optimization algorithms, while UQlab [@marelli2014uqlab] (Matlab) and ChaosPy [@feinberg2015chaospy] provide the PCE algorithm.  

A list of key references, including to other software addressing related needs. Note that the references should include full names of venues, e.g., journals and conferences, not abbreviations only understood in the context of a specific discipline.

The robust design optimization framework has been applied on hydrogen-based 
energy systems, developed in Python: A directly-coupled 
photovoltaic-electrolyzer system [@Coppitters2019a] and a photovoltaic-battery-hydrogen system [@coppitters2020robust]. In addition, an Aspen Plus model of a 
power-to-ammonia model has been connected to the framework and optimized under uncertainty [@verleysen2020can].
Other Aspen Plus models have been optimized under uncertainty as well through 
RHEIA: a micro gas turbine with a carbon capture plant [@giorgetti2019] and a 
micro gas turbine [@Paepe2019a]. Finally, uncertainty quantification has been
performed on an EnergyScope model [@limpensa2020impact].


# Future work

The following improvements will be made in future versions of RHEIA:

- Including a sparse PCE algorithm, developed in our research group, to handle the curse-of-dimensionality for high-dimensional problems [@Abraham2017]. To ensure a smooth inclusion of this sparse PCE algorithm in RHEIA, the ``pce`` module has been built by the authors, as opposed to adopting an existing PCE package in Python, such as ChaosPy [@feinberg2015chaospy].
- Including optimization algorithm alternatives (i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization, Firefly Algorithm, Cuckoo Search), following the experience gained in our research group on using these algorithms in a surrogate-assisted robust design optimization context [@Tsirikoglou2017].
- Adding additional models on hydrogen-based energy carrier production and utilization (e.g. ammonia, biomethane) in power-to-gas applications.
