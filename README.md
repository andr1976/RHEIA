The Robust design optimization of renewable Hydrogen and dErIved energy cArrier systems (RHEIA) framework provides 
multi-objective optimization (deterministic and stochastic) and uncertainty quantification algorithms. 
These algorithms can be applied on hydrogen-based energy systems, which are included in RHEIA.
In addition, RHEIA allows to connect your own models to the algorithms as well.
